Not all the original presets that come with WinFF work with the Debian
version of ffmpeg. Therefore, a filtered version is provided as a
standard. The original presets are still provided in 
/usr/share/winff/presets-orig.xml and can be loaded into the program.

If you use an unofficial version of ffmpeg you might want the presets 
with the new style of LIBRARY names versus the old CODEC name for ffmpeg.
For you convenience newer presets are provided in /usr/share/winff/
and should replace or be merged with your ~/.winff/presets.xml (and 
/usr/share/winff/presets.xml for system wide update). Unfortunately the
API of ffmpeg changes once in a while, so you will have to check which
version of libavcodec you have. The new presets files are named after
the supported libavcodec.
